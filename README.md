REMWaste
=========

## development
I started with consuming the api using useEffect, then moved onto layout, UX design and finished off with responsiveness. I went with a white background because of UX considerations, as most users are familiar with neutral themes. I also chose to use Impact font because it communicates information of high importance like signage, safety messages; which applies to the nature of your business.

## How to run the app

Run (npm run dev) from the main directory to compile for development.
